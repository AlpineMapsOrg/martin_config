- search for the linebreaks: \n in the document and replace them with nothing in order to remove them

# Convert to SQL

1. activate virutal environment

```source venv/bin/activate```

2. download the json file (see above)

3. call convert.py

```python3 convert.py type file.json```

by calling the convert.py script we can convert the json files into appropriate postgresql insert into queries. Note for panomax we still have to call the panomax website since some information (webcam urls) are still locked behind additional website requests. Those additional website calls are also already programmed into the convert.py file.
